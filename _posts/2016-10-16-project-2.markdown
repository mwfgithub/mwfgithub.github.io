description: Assalamualaikum,

The Muslim Water Fund (MWF) is supporting the development of a single well within a village in Kabul city, Afghanistan. Due to the nature of the instability of the region, we cannot risk the release of any private information that may jeopardize the safety of those involved within the village.  The project details are below, the following is a transcript from a local regarding the need for the well in the community:

"In our village, there are two wells, one is within a mosque and the other is placed outside the walls of the mosque close to the public school. The well was built beside the mosque with a distance of 50 meters and was close to a public school that had a population of over a thousand students by the good deeds of a kind person with his own money. This well was built 7 or 8 years ago giving access to the whole community as well as providing water to the well within the mosque through a water pipe. This helped the mosque drastically as many people were able to make wudhu and quenching their thirst.

The well inside the mosque was providing enough water with the help of the well outside of the mosque to the public and the school.  Together both wells were sufficient. However,  its been three years that the water level has decreased. Only the well within the mosque is available for the use of the mosque which in itself is not sufficient. Another problem that we face is that once the well is used, the water goes down and a wait time of a few minutes are required for it to be used again, which increases wait time for each person.

We have been asked to ask you for your help. Anyone who helps and puts effort in shall be rewarded as it is a big reward as it saves lives. It is a big help for people who are praying as well as people who are thirsty. The public has recommended if possible to dig the well between 80-90 meters  in depth with a diameter of 13 inch which they hope will suffice, but of course,  consultation with companies that deals with those technicalities will be taken."

Following discussions, a local organization was contracted to provide a quote following consultation with an engineer. The original plan was to rebuild the old well, however found to be not possible due to the low water level in that location and the extra costs associated.  It was found feasible to rather build a new well, the issue remains that the water level is low and thus costs are slightly higher than usual. The engineer estimated that the ground must be dug up to 70m in order to have a functional well with clean water.  The following estimates were provided to the Muslim Water Fund.

1) For every meter dug 1,000 Afghanis (70)meter = 70,000 Afghanis $1,060 USD

2) Water pump for 70 meters 330 Afghani per meter = 23,100 afghani $350 USD

3) Water pipe lines 70 meters 230 feet pipe lines 33,000 afghani $500

4) Cement around well 13,200 afghani $200 USD

5) Lable Marble granite stone for well 6,600 afghani $100 usd

6) General label for 2 weeks of work for engineers and well makers 19,140 afghani $290 USD

Total cost $2,500 dollars 

We are making an urgent appeal to support this project and assist through your duas and donations. We are not collecting any administration fees on our part and inshallah we want to start this project as soon as possible due to the need of the community, but we can't do this without you! Take part of this noble cause and inshallah Allah will be the one that rewards.
